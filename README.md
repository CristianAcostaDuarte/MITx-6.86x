# MITx Micromasters Machine Learning Project

This GitHub repository contains a collection of machine learning projects completed as part of the MITx Micromasters program. The projects cover various topics in machine learning, ranging from the basics like linear regression and logistic regression to more complex topics such as deep learning, recommender systems using k-nearest neighbors, and reinforcement learning. The repository also incorporates GitHub Actions to include a DevOps cycle for code monitoring and testing.

## Project Descriptions

1. **Linear Regression for House Price Prediction**

   The first project focuses on using linear regression to predict the values of houses. By analyzing a dataset containing various features of houses (such as area, number of rooms, etc.) along with their corresponding prices, we trained a model to estimate the price of a new house based on its features. This project provides a solid foundation in regression and explores the relationships between house attributes and their market values.

2. **Spam Classification Using Bag-of-Words**

   The second project involves building a spam classification model using a bag-of-words approach. We trained a machine learning model to classify emails as either spam or non-spam based on the presence of specific keywords or patterns. By representing each email as a collection of words and applying techniques such as feature extraction, we created a model capable of effectively distinguishing between spam and non-spam emails. This project showcases the application of classification algorithms in the field of email filtering.

3. **Digit Recognition with Multiple Neural Network Architectures**

   In the third project, we delve into the realm of multi-classification and digit recognition using various neural network architectures. Utilizing a dataset of handwritten digits, we implemented and compared multiple network designs, including feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). By evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of each architecture, we gained insights into their performance on the task of digit recognition. This project highlights the versatility and capabilities of different neural network structures.

4. **Movie Recommender System using k-Nearest Neighbors**

   The final project focuses on building a movie recommender system using the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. Leveraging a Netflix movie database, we applied collaborative filtering techniques to recommend movies to users based on their preferences and similarities to other users. By utilizing the k-NN algorithm, we identified movies that align with a user's viewing history and provided personalized recommendations. This project demonstrates the power of recommendation systems and showcases the practical application of k-NN algorithms.

The GitHub repository serves as a comprehensive collection of these machine learning projects, enabling others to explore and learn from the code implementations. The incorporation of GitHub Actions ensures a streamlined DevOps cycle, allowing for continuous integration, monitoring, and testing of the project codebase.
